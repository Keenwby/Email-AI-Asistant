# Guides Overview

This directory will host non-technical documentation aimed at operators, end users, and stakeholders.

## Structure Plan

| Guide | Status | Purpose |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| [`user-guide.md`](user-guide.md) | Drafted | Day-to-day walkthrough for running reports and interpreting outputs. |
| [`gmail-oauth.md`](gmail-oauth.md) | Drafted | Step-by-step instructions for creating Gmail OAuth credentials. |

## How It Relates to the Technical Pack

- Technical onboarding lives in `docs/ghp/` and targets engineers.
- Guides in this folder share the same narratives but focus on non-engineering personas.

Add new files here as additional guides become available, keeping the table above in sync.
